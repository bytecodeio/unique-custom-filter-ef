Extension Framework app that passes all dashboard values to external Bootstrap-React components to the navbar using javascript events. It passes checkboxes values to a checkbox component and radio button values to a radio button component. The components outside of the iframe update ALL dashboards in the app at the same time.

Run yarn and yarn dev to run the app locally. Then yarn run build to build the app.
